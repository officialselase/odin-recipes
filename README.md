# odin-recipes

## Project Description
Odin Recipes is a simple web development project created as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum. The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using HTML, demonstrating foundational web development skills and best practices.

The website will consist of:
- A main index page linking to individual recipe pages.
- Each recipe page will include a title, an image, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step cooking instructions.

This project focuses on:
- Structuring content using semantic HTML.
- Linking pages using relative paths.
- Embedding images into web pages.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I aim to demonstrate the following skills:
1. **HTML Structure**:
   - Proper use of semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
   - Effective use of `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` for lists.
2. **File Management**:
   - Organizing project files (HTML, images) into a clean directory structure.
   - Understanding relative and absolute paths for linking resources.
3. **Version Control**:
   - Creating and managing a Git repository for the project.
   - Writing meaningful commit messages.
   - Pushing changes to a remote GitHub repository.
4. **Collaboration Readiness**:
   - Using a clear and descriptive README file for project documentation.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your-username/odin-recipes.git

Future Goals
Once the basic HTML structure is complete, I plan to:

Expand the website with additional recipes.
Use CSS to style the pages and make the website visually appealing.
Add JavaScript for interactivity, such as form validation or recipe filtering.
Reflection
At the end of the project, I will revisit this README to reflect on what Iâ€™ve learned and document any challenges faced during development.
